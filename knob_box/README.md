I made a box with 4 knobs that works as a midi controller. The wiring looks like this:

I didn't actually use an Arduino UNO like the picture shows. I used two boards
 - Analog Devices ADICUP360 Rev 1.1 with the ADICUP360 Eclipse IDE.
 - LPCXpresso v2 11U68 Rev C with the mbed platform.
 
The reason I wrote code for both of these is that I broke the Analog Devices board. Don't solder in the dark :)
